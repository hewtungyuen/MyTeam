# BT3103 (Application Systems Development for Business Analytics) - MyTeam

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The objective of this project is to develop a web application that serves as a project management
system, where project teams can use it to easily assign tasks and keep track of each otherâ€™s
progress. To develop the web application, VueJS and Google Firebase were used as the frontend
and backend respectively. Our team followed the SCRUM software development framework, and
used Git and GitHub as our version control tools. Over the course of five weeks, the team
conducted three sprints and five weekly standups, successfully completing 40 out of 50 functional
requirements, and 13 out of 20 non-functional requirements.
